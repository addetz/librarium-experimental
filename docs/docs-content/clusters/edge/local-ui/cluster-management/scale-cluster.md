Once a cluster is operational, you have the option of scaling up the cluster by adding additional nodes, or scale down
the cluster by removing nodes from the cluster using Local UI.

## Scale up a Cluster

### Prerequisites

- You have an active cluster composed of hosts installed in airgap mode. For more information, refer to
  [Create Local Cluster](./create-cluster.md).

- The new nodes you plan to add to the cluster are linked with the nodes in the existing cluster. For more information,
  refer to [Create]
