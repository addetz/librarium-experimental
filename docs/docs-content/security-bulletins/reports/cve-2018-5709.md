## NIST Summary

kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a "u4" variable to it, which
is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a
Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.
