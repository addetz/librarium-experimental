[CVE-2023-0216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0216)

## Last Update

## NIST Summary

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the
d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.

The result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS
implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on
untrusted data.
