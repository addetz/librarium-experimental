## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-39323](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39323)

## Last Update

1/4/2024

## NIST Summary

Line directives ("//line") can be used to bypass the restrictions on "//go:cgo\_" directives, allowing blocked linker
and compiler flags to be passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when
running "go build". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes
exploiting this issue significantly more complex.

## CVE Severity

8.1

## Status

Resolved
