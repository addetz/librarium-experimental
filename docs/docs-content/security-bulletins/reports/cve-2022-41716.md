## CVE Details

[CVE-2022-41716](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41716)

## Last Update

11/7/2023

## NIST Summary

Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment variables on Windows. In
syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked
for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment
variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\\x00C=D" sets the variables "A=B" and "C=D".

## CVE Severity
