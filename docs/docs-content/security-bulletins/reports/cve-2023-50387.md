## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-50387](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50387)

## Last Update

6/10/2024

## NIST Summary

Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the "KeyTrap" issue. One of the
concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an
algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.

## CVE Severity
