## CVE Details

[CVE-2022-3996](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3996)

## Last Update

8/1/2024

## NIST Summary

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will
be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when
the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common
setup.

Policy processing is enabled by passing the \`-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
\`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.
